# Deep Learning Final

## Overview

This project was the final for my Deep Learning class. We were given the titanic dataset from Kaggle and particippated in the cometition. The chalenge is on to see how good a model you can create to predict which passengers lived and died. We did this using feed forward neural networks and the file in this repo is straight from Google Collab.
